STANC3 RELEASE NOTES
======================================================================

v2.30.1 (27 July 2022)
======================================================================

- Improved the pedantic mode warning for parameters without priors. The message now highlights when it is safe to ignore it.
- Fixed a bug in the memory pattern optimization where a for loop generated for the function inliner would prevent detection of for loops higher in the control flow graph.
- Fixed an issue with the function inliner when a function local variable had the same name as a variable in the calling scope.
- Fixed an issue where recursive functions which called themselves with a slice of their arguments would lead to infinite template expansion in C++ compilation.
- Fixed a bug in stanc.js where the stanc flags were not listed correctly in the generated C++.
- The imaginary components of complex vectors and matrices are now initialized to NaN to match the real component and behaviour of non-complex vectors and matrices.

v2.30.0 (1 July 2022)
======================================================================

Complex:
 - Added complex containers: `complex_matrix`, `complex_vector`, and `complex_row_vector` with basic arithmetic support. (#1133)
 - Fixed indexing of a complex container to return the correct type. (#1158)
 - Added many common linear algebra functions and container operations for complex types. (#1166)
 - Fixed an issue reading in `complex_matrix` in the data block. (#1168)
 - Added vectorized signatures for `get_real` and `get_imag`, e.g. `get_real(complex_matrix) => matrix`. (#1169)
 - Added `fft`, `inv_fft`, `fft2`, and `inv_fft2` to the language. (#1170)
 - `pow` (and subsequently the `^` operator) now have overloads for complex containers. (#1186)
 - `to_complex` is now vectorized. This means signatures like `to_complex(matrix, matrix) => complex_matrix` are now available. (#1208)
 - Added signatures for addition, subtraction and division which mix scalars and complex vector types, broadcasting the scalar as appropriate. (#1212)
 - Added `svd_U`, `svd_V`, `singular_values`, `eigenvalues_sym`, and `eigenvectors_sym` for complex inputs. (#1212)

New functions:
 - Added `L1` and `L2` norms. (#1140)
 - Added `log_determinant_spd` which is faster when the input matrix is known to be symmetric and positive definite. (#1178)
 - Added `wishart_cholesky_lpdf` and `wishart_cholesky_rng` distribution functions. (#1188)
 - Added `multi_student_t_cholesky_lpdf` and `multi_student_t_cholesky_rng` distribution functions. (#1197)
 - Added `inv_wishart_cholesky_lpdf` and `inv_wishart_cholesky_rng` distribution functions. (#1202)
 - Exposes inv_inc_beta. (#1211)

Misc:
 - Re-enabled function inlining optimizations at O1. (#1097)
 - Modified the optimizer to turn statements like `3 + 4i` into `to_complex(3,4)` directly. (#1112)
 - Added `cumulative_sum(Vector/RowVector)` for `var<Matrix>` types. (#1152)
 - Improved compile times by accumulating all template requirements into a single `require_all_t` on user defined functions. (#1157)
 - The `--info` and `--debug-generate-data` commands now use the Yojson library for it's output. (#1161, #1175)
 - Bugfixed for output values in `write_array` that should be `NaN`. (#1165)
 - `--dump-stan-math-signatures` now prints an entire signature on one line, no matter how long it is. (#1167)
 - Fix --debug-generate-data for ordered vector data types. (#1173)
 - Exposed an overload for `cumulative_sum` which takes and returns an array of integers. (#1174)
 - The javascript interface (stancjs) now generates errors which look more like stanc3's by pointing out where in the supplied code the error occurred. (#1177)
 - Cleaned up the internal structuring of modules in the compiler. (#1179)
 - Cleaned up code for pretty printing the Middle Intermediate Representation (MIR). (#1180)
 - Added `--debug-mem-patterns` flag, which will print out the memory type of variables (either Array of Structs or the more efficient Struct of Arrays pattern) when optimization is enabled. (#1185)
 - Allowed the adding of new distributions without requiring them to support deprecated suffixes. (#1191)
 - Added `eigenvectors` and `eigenvalues` functions which return the complex-valued eigenvectors or eigenvalues of a real (asymmetrix) matrix. (#1192)
 - `abs` is now vectorized for container types. `fabs` is now deprecated, as all usages can be replaced with `abs` thanks to array promotion rules. (#1195)
 - Made installing the developer tools for the Stanc repository an interactive script with error handling. (#1200)
 - Internally clean up how variable declarations are represented. (#1203)
 - Simplified internal representations in the compiler. (#1204)
 - The pretty-printer now preserves multiple declarations in one line like `int a, b;` rather than splitting them into two declarations. (#1207)
 - Declarations are now allowed in places they previously would not parse, such as the only statement in the body of an if statement. (#1207)
 - `./`, `/` `.*`, and `*` now have consistent behavior with scalar arguments. (#1209)

v2.29.1 (2 March 2022)
======================================================================

- Formatting without a | when only one argument is supplied to a distribution.

- Improved type error messages for operators and tilde statements.

v2.29.0 (14 February 2022)
======================================================================

FEATURES
 - Allow most reserved words in C++ (e.g., `public`) to appear in a stan program; they will be changed by the compiler to `_stan_<reserved word>` in the generated C++. (#962)
 - User defined functions can now be overloaded. Multiple definitions of the same function name are allowed if the arguments are different in each definition.(#1027)
 - Improved error messages for incorrect variable declarations. (#1099)
 - When an unknown identifier is encountered Stan will suggest nearby known names you might have meant (#1024)
 - Extra semicolons in `data` or `parameters` no longer produce syntax errors. (#988)
 - Improved error messages for incomplete probability library calls. (#1021)
 - Added nicer error message when a comment is unterminated at end of input. (#1025)
 - All internal compiler errors now include a link to the stanc3 issues page. (#1028)
 - Improve error messages when a user tries to declare a function argument as a constrained type. (#1030)
 - Replaced the use of the word twiddle with tilde in pedantic warning messages. (#1050)
 - Allow user-defined densities over complex arguments and deeply nested arguments. (#1046)
 - Added optimization layers `--O0` (default), `--O1`, and `--Oexperimental`
 - Turn back on allowing immediately assigned to decls not be NaN initialized at `O1` (#1029)
 - Allows `log_prob_impl` to use Struct of Arrays type for reverse mode autodiff at `O1` (#955)
 - Issue a warning when a user has a model with unreachable statements, such as code following a `return` statement. (#1063)
 - The compiler can now compile or format standalone function definitions in a `.stanfunctions` file. These are compiled as if a normal Stan program was compiled with `stanc3 --standalone-functions` and can be used with `#include` statements in the `functions` block (#1022)
 - The canonicalizer can now have each part enabled seperately. This can be done with commands like `stanc --auto-format --canonicalize=braces,deprecations <model>`. Current options are `deprecations`, `braces`, and `parenthesis`. (#1058)
 - Ensure the canonicalizer properly prints nested if-else statements. (#1055)
 - `--auto-format` no longer prints code which originated from an `#include` directive. This can be re-enabled by using `canonicalize=includes`. (#1069)
 - When using `--auto-format`, the user can now pass `--max-line-length=#` to set the column number at which the formatter will try to break lines. (#1068)

 - Clean up more mutable state in the Javascript interface (#1118)

DEPRECATIONS
 - Added a warning for `matrix^scalar` that points users to `.^` and `matrix_power()`. (#1026)
 - Warn about the following identifiers being reserved in a future version: `array`, `upper`, `lower`, `offset`, `multiplier`. (#1048)
 - The old form of declaring arrays like `real a[5]`, which has been deprecated since 2.26, now issues a warning. (#1072)
